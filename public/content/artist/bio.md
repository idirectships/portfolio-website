## AI Implementation Specialist & Ex-FAANG Recruiter

Transitioning from talent acquisition at top tech companies to hands-on AI engineering. 
Passionate about building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems while 
maintaining the human element in technology.

### Background

With years of experience as a Senior Technical Recruiter at FAANG companies, I developed 
a deep understanding of the tech talent landscape and the challenges both companies and 
candidates face. This unique perspective drives my current focus on AI implementation 
and development.

### Current Focus

- AI system design and implementation
- Machine learning model development  
- Technical recruiting automation
- Building AI-powered tools for talent acquisition
- Bridging the gap between human insight and AI capabilities

### Philosophy

Technology should amplify human potential, not replace it. My work focuses on creating 
AI systems that enhance human decision-making and create better experiences for everyone 
involved in the process.
